# TODOS

- Free memory properly (seems to be impossible)
- Construct a better hash table
    - Hashtable should use better hash function
    - Hashtable should resize properly
- Current Implementation has zero error checking. Negative numbers and numbers
  greater than VEBTree in main function break the program. Hence need more
  error checking. To achieve this, insert and delete might have to return true
  or falses
- Maybe try to increase the size of universe to uint64_t (ask team)
- Formatting style to use: `Microsoft`
